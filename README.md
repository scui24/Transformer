# CS337 Project 3 -- Recipe Transformer
# Group 3- Recipe Parsing & Recipe Transformer

This project uses a variety of web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and text-processing libraries/packages for designing and building a system that (i) parsing online recipes into a useful data representation and (ii) transforming recipe into different cuisines or recipe styles. 

## Libraries/Packages Overview
1. **requests**: The Requests is a Python library that allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.
   
2. **re**: re is a Python built-in package, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.
   
3. **bs4**: Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
